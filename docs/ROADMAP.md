# BoardReadyOps v2 Roadmap

> Tracking issue: [#260 — BoardReadyOps v2 — From KiCad project to verified manufacturing release](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/260)

## Vision

Evolve BoardReadyOps from a KiCad release-readiness gate into an end-to-end hardware release operating system.

The target workflow is:

```
Generate → Validate → Decide → Package → Attest → Review → Handoff
```

BoardReadyOps should turn a KiCad project into a verified, signed, manufacturer-ready release package — running locally or in CI, producing auditable evidence, and blocking unsafe releases before boards are ordered.

## Workstreams

### 1. KiCad Artifact Generation Engine ([Epic #261](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/261))

First-party `kicad-cli` integration that produces Gerber, drill, BOM, CPL, PDF, and STEP outputs from a KiCad project. Replaces the need for KiBot for standard manufacturing workflows.

### 2. One-Command Release Prepare Pipeline ([Epic #262](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/262))

`boardreadyops release prepare` orchestrates the full pipeline: discover → generate → validate → decide → package. Produces a structured release decision JSON and evidence bundle in one command.

### 3. Evidence Bundle v2 & Signed Manifests ([Epic #263](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/263))

Formal evidence bundle layout with schema version 2, role-based artifact groups, checksums file, and Ed25519 signature support for trusted manufacturing releases.

### 4. Manufacturer Handoff Packages ([Epic #264](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/264))

Vendor-specific handoff packages (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park) that contain only the files required by that manufacturer, with a readable manufacturer note and manifest.

### 5. Vendor Readiness Scoring ([Epic #265](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/265))

0–100 readiness score per vendor profile, with required/recommended evidence weighting, score explanations in reports, and policy integration.

### 6. Visual Release Dashboard ([Epic #266](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/266))

Product-quality HTML release dashboard with decision overview, score cards, generated artifact list, vendor readiness, findings, waivers, and evidence manifest sections.

### 7. Release-to-Release Diff Engine ([Epic #267](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/267))

BOM and CPL diff between two release candidates or evidence bundles. JSON, Markdown, and HTML outputs for PR comments and dashboard sections.

### 8. Variant-Aware Hardware Release ([Epic #268](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/268))

Prototype and production variant support across generation, validation, packaging, and release decisions. `--variant` flag and variant-specific output paths.

### 9. Policy Engine & Release Governance ([Epic #269](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/269))

Configurable policy layer with severity thresholds, vendor readiness thresholds, waiver-aware decisions, and `boardreadyops policy simulate`.

### 10. Waivers & Approval Workflow ([Epic #270](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/270))

Formal waiver schema with owner, reason, expiry, and approval metadata. Expired waivers block production release policy.

### 11. Provenance, Attestations & Hardware SLSA ([Epic #271](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/271))

Supply-chain provenance metadata, GitHub Artifact Attestation integration, signed release manifests, and Hardware Release Level model.

### 12. HBOM & BOM Intelligence ([Epic #272](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/272))

Structured hardware bill of materials (HBOM) output, MPN normalization, component identity checks, and plugin-ready supplier intelligence hooks.

### 13. Firmware-Hardware Contract Ecosystem ([Epic #273](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/273))

Stable adapter interface for multiple firmware ecosystems: PlatformIO, Zephyr, ESP-IDF, STM32CubeMX. Pin, peripheral, and boot/debug connector checks.

### 14. DFM/DFA Rule Corpus Expansion ([Epic #274](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/274))

Extended manufacturing and assembly risk rules covering polarity markers, pin-1 markers, silkscreen over pad, and initial test point coverage warnings.

### 15. GitHub App & PR Release Gate ([Epic #275](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/275))

Native GitHub App with check run lifecycle, PR comment strategy, and dashboard/evidence links. Complements the existing GitHub Action for zero-config integration.

### 16. Cloud Dashboard & Vercel Control Plane ([Epic #276](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/276))

Hosted web dashboard and API on Vercel with GitHub App integration, artifact storage, and execution plane for KiCad-heavy jobs.

### 17. Golden Demo & Bad-Board Zoo ([Epic #277](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/277))

Production-quality demo repo and intentionally broken fixture corpus that demonstrate and regression-test all major BoardReadyOps findings.

## Definition of Success

A hardware team can run:

```bash
boardreadyops release prepare . --profile jlcpcb
boardreadyops handoff create build/release --profile jlcpcb
```

And receive:
- A verified, signed evidence bundle capturing artifacts, decisions, and provenance
- A clean manufacturer handoff package ready to upload
- A human-readable dashboard for engineering review
- A machine-readable decision JSON for CI gates
