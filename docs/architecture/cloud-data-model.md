# BoardReadyOps Cloud — Dashboard Data and Artifact Storage Model

**Issue:** [#305](https://github.com/oaslananka/boardreadyops/issues/305)
**Related:** [ADR-0008 — Vercel control plane](adr/0008-vercel-control-plane.md), [GitHub App RFC](github-app-rfc.md)

## Overview

This document defines the minimum data model required for the hosted BoardReadyOps dashboard and API. It is intentionally schema-first to guide implementation without prematurely committing to ORM details.

All tables are scoped to a GitHub App `installation_id`. Cross-installation data access is not permitted.

---

## Entities

### Installation

Represents a GitHub App installation on an organization or personal account.

```typescript
interface Installation {
  id: string;                      // internal UUID
  githubInstallationId: number;    // GitHub App installation_id
  accountLogin: string;            // org or user login
  accountType: "Organization" | "User";
  planTier: "free" | "pro" | "team";
  createdAt: Date;
  suspendedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Repository

A repository registered under an installation.

```typescript
interface Repository {
  id: string;
  installationId: string;           // → Installation.id
  githubRepoId: number;
  owner: string;
  name: string;
  private: boolean;
  defaultBranch: string;
  enabledAt: Date;
  disabledAt?: Date;
}
```

### ReleaseRun

One BoardReadyOps check execution on a specific commit.

```typescript
interface ReleaseRun {
  id: string;
  repositoryId: string;             // → Repository.id
  commitSha: string;
  ref: string;                      // branch or tag
  pullRequestNumber?: number;
  triggerKind: "push" | "pr" | "manual" | "workflow_dispatch";
  status: "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "timed_out" | "failed";
  decision: "pass" | "fail" | "error" | null;
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  durationMs?: number;
  boardReadyOpsVersion?: string;
  kicadVersion?: string;
  githubCheckRunId?: number;
  // Derived summary counts (denormalized for dashboard queries)
  findingCountError: number;
  findingCountHigh: number;
  findingCountMedium: number;
  findingCountLow: number;
  findingCountInfo: number;
  readinessScore?: number;
}
```

### Finding

Individual rule violation from a release run.

```typescript
interface Finding {
  id: string;
  runId: string;                    // → ReleaseRun.id
  ruleId: string;                   // e.g. "manufacturing.fiducials"
  severity: "error" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "info";
  message: string;
  path?: string;
  kind?: string;
  waivedAt?: Date;
  waiverId?: string;                // → Waiver.id if waived
}
```

### Artifact

A file included in the release evidence bundle.

```typescript
interface Artifact {
  id: string;
  runId: string;                    // → ReleaseRun.id
  kind: "gerber" | "drill" | "bom" | "position" | "pdf" | "step" | "report" | "manifest" | "other";
  name: string;                     // display name
  storagePath: string;              // internal path in artifact store (not public)
  sha256: string;
  bytes: number;
  role: "fabrication" | "assembly" | "documentation" | "report" | "evidence";
  uploadedAt: Date;
}
```

### Waiver

An intentional risk acceptance for a specific finding.

```typescript
interface Waiver {
  id: string;
  repositoryId: string;             // → Repository.id
  ruleId: string;
  reason: string;
  owner: string;                    // email or login of approver
  approvedBy?: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  revokedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Policy

Stored release policy configuration for a repository.

```typescript
interface Policy {
  id: string;
  repositoryId: string;             // → Repository.id
  configJson: string;               // serialized policy YAML/JSON
  active: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Private Artifact Access

Artifacts for private repositories are stored with a non-guessable path prefix and are never served from a public URL.

**Download flow:**

1. Authenticated client calls `GET /api/v1/runs/{runId}/artifacts/{artifactId}/download`
2. API verifies the caller has `read` access to the installation (via GitHub App installation token)
3. API generates a signed URL with a 15-minute TTL pointing to the storage backend
4. Client downloads directly from the signed URL

No artifact binary content passes through the API server on download.

## Dashboard Pages and Required Data

| Page | Required entities |
|---|---|
| Repository overview | `Repository`, last 10 `ReleaseRun` (summary) |
| Run detail | `ReleaseRun`, `Finding[]`, `Artifact[]` (manifest) |
| Evidence browser | `Artifact[]` with signed download URLs |
| Waiver management | `Waiver[]`, `Finding[]` (waived) |
| Policy configuration | `Policy`, `ReleaseRun` (simulated) |
| Release history diff | Two `ReleaseRun` records + associated `Finding[]` |

## Future Migration Path

The data model is designed to be database-agnostic (no PostgreSQL-specific types in the schema above). Migration considerations:

- **Schema versioning**: use a `schema_version` table and Prisma migrations from day 1.
- **Multi-region**: findings and artifacts are append-only; replication to read replicas is straightforward.
- **Tenant isolation**: all queries filter by `installationId`; adding row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL does not require schema changes.
- **Artifact store swap**: `storagePath` is internal. Switching from Vercel Blob to R2 or S3 requires a data migration script but no schema change.
- **Self-hosted**: the data model supports a self-hosted deployment by replacing the GitHub App credentials and storage backend without structural changes.
