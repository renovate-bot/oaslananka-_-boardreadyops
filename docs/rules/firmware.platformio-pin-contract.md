# firmware.platformio-pin-contract

## What It Checks

Checks a PlatformIO-style firmware pin contract against BoardReadyOps pinmap firmware labels.

## When It Fires

Fires when firmware assigns a signal to the wrong hardware pin/net, adds a signal not in hardware, or omits a hardware firmware signal.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  firmware.platformio-pin-contract:
    enabled: true
    severity: high
```

## JSON Finding Details Shape

```text
{ firmware, hardware, sources }
```

## Report Context

Use this finding to decide whether the design package is ready for review, fabrication, or release. BoardReadyOps reports the condition and leaves design edits to the owning workflow.
