## What It Checks

Checks KiCad PCB stackup layer count against expected copper layers.

## When It Fires

Fires when the stackup block contains a different copper layer count than expected.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  manufacturing.layer-stackup:
    enabled: true
    severity: medium
```

## JSON Finding Details Shape

```text
{ expectedLayers, stackupLayers }
```

## Report Context
