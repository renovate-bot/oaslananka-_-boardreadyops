This example pins the current main Action commit because the input table below
is generated from the repository's current \`action.yml\`. The public
\`v1.3.0\` tag remains smoke-tested in the release channel matrix and includes
all current inputs.

## Inputs

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
${rows}

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
${outputs}

## Pull request comments

When \`comment-pr\` is enabled, the sticky pull request comment summarizes the current findings. If the Action can read a previous BoardReadyOps JSON artifact from the pull request head branch or base branch, the comment also includes a fabrication diff for BOM rows, manufacturing outputs, and newly added findings.

## Notifiers

The Action honors the repository \`notifiers\` configuration from \`boardreadyops.yml\`. Webhook URLs, Telegram bot tokens, and SMTP credentials must be supplied through workflow environment variables or secrets referenced by the configured \`webhookEnv\`, \`botTokenEnv\`, or \`smtpEnv\` names. Delivery is best-effort: missing credentials, severity filters, and notifier failures do not change the Action exit code. Action notifications include a link to the current workflow run when GitHub exposes the run metadata.
